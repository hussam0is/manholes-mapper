# Sketch Export/Import Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive export/import system for your manholes mapper application that **preserves all data including x,y coordinates**.

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **New Export/Import Module** (`manholes/src/utils/sketch-io.js`)
   - `exportSketchToJson()` - Exports complete sketch to JSON
   - `importSketchFromJson()` - Imports and validates sketch from JSON
   - Full validation of imported data structure
   - Preserves all coordinates, properties, and metadata

### 2. **UI Buttons Added**
   - **Desktop toolbar**: Download (⬇️) and Upload (⬆️) icons
   - **Mobile menu**: "יצוא שרטוט" and "יבוא שרטוט" buttons
   - Hidden file input for importing JSON files

### 3. **Event Handlers** (in `main.js`)
   - Export button: Creates JSON file with all sketch data
   - Import button: Opens file picker
   - File change handler: Validates and loads imported sketch
   - Confirmation dialog before replacing current sketch
   - Success/error toast notifications

### 4. **Translations** (Hebrew & English)
   - Button labels
   - Toast messages
   - Alert messages
   - Error messages

## 📊 What's Preserved in Export

The JSON export includes **everything**:

✅ **Node Data:**
- **x, y coordinates** (exact float values)
- ID, type, nodeType
- Material, coverDiameter
- Access, accuracyLevel
- Maintenance and engineering status
- Notes

✅ **Edge Data:**
- Tail and head node IDs
- All measurements (tail, head, fall depth)
- Line diameter, material, type
- Engineering and maintenance status
- Notes

✅ **Sketch Metadata:**
- Creation date
- Sketch name
- nextNodeId (maintains ID sequence)
- Schema version (for future compatibility)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Export a Sketch:
1. Click the download icon (⬇️) in the toolbar
2. File automatically downloads as `sketch_[name]_[date].json`
3. Toast notification confirms export

### Import a Sketch:
1. Click the upload icon (⬆️) in the toolbar
2. Select a JSON file
3. Confirm replacement if you have a current sketch
4. Sketch loads with all coordinates preserved
5. View automatically recenters on the sketch

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `manholes/src/utils/sketch-io.js` - Export/import utilities
- `manholes/SKETCH_EXPORT_IMPORT.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `manholes/sample_sketch_export.json` - Example export file
- `EXPORT_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files:
- `manholes/index.html` - Added export/import buttons and file input
- `manholes/src/legacy/main.js` - Added event handlers and DOM references
- `manholes/src/i18n.js` - Added Hebrew and English translations

## 🔍 Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportDate": "2024-10-13T12:00:00.000Z",
  "sketch": {
    "name": "My Project",
    "creationDate": "2024-10-13",
    "nextNodeId": 5,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "x": 250.5,
        "y": 180.3,
        "nodeType": "Manhole",
        "note": "Main junction",
        ...
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "tail": "1",
        "head": "2",
        "tail_measurement": "1.5",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Coordinate Preservation**: x,y values preserved as floating-point numbers
2. **Full Validation**: Checks structure, required fields, and data types
3. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid imports
4. **Safety**: Prompts before replacing current sketch
5. **Offline Support**: Works with IndexedDB (PWA)
6. **Bilingual**: Full Hebrew and English support
7. **Mobile Ready**: Works on both desktop and mobile

## 🔄 Differences from CSV Export

| Feature | JSON Export | CSV Export |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Coordinates** | ✅ Included | ❌ Not included |
| **Re-import** | ✅ Full restore | ❌ Not supported |
| **Format** | Single JSON | Separate files |
| **Purpose** | Backup/sharing | Excel analysis |

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation has been:
- ✅ Built successfully with Vite
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All translations added (Hebrew & English)
- ✅ Event handlers properly integrated
- ✅ Sample export file created for testing

## 📋 To Test:

1. Start the dev server: `cd manholes && npm run dev`
2. Create a sketch with some nodes and edges
3. Click the download icon to export
4. Create a new sketch
5. Click the upload icon and select your exported file
6. Verify all nodes appear at correct positions

## 🎁 Sample File

I've created `manholes/sample_sketch_export.json` which you can use to test the import functionality. It includes:
- 4 nodes (2 manholes, 1 drainage, 1 home)
- 3 edges connecting them
- All positioned at specific x,y coordinates
